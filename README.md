## Car-Assembly

### Displays all auto manufacturer locations and vehicles made in each facility in North America (US, Canada, ad Mexico)
- Idea of this project is to illustrate the size of the automotive industry
- Hovering map markers will display the name of the manufaturing plant
- Clicking on a map marker displays all cars made at that manufacturing plant
